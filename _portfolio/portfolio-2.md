**Rapid context changes at encoding disrupt hippocampal autocorrelation and reduce temporal clustering of free recall**

**Project Goals:**

**Explore How Context Changes Affect Memory Organization:** Investigate how changing the background environment at different speeds while learning words influences how people remember the order of those words later.

**Explore How Context Changes Affect Brain Activity:** Investigate how changing the background environment at different speeds influences activity in the hippocampus.

**Link Brain Activity to Memory Organization:** Examine whether changes in activity in the hippocampus during learning are connected to how people group and recall memories based on the order they were learned.
