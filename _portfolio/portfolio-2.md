<h1 style="font-size:24px;">RAPID CONTEXT CHANGES INFLUENCE HIPPOCAMPAL ACTIVITY AND ORGANIZATION OF MEMORIES</h1>


The hippocampus is a region in the brain that is critical for forming long term memories. Specifically, the hippocampus is essential for linking memories of past experiences to rich contextual details—memory for ‘where’ or ‘when’ an event took place. For example, recalling your wedding day may bring to mind the beautiful floral-covered canopy under which you were married. Prior research has shown that context also powerfully shapes the order in which items are remembered- or how memories are organized. This has been demonstrated in previous research, where participants tend to recall items in the order they were learned. This phenomenon is known as _temporal clustering_. At present, however, there is limited evidence linking context representations in the hippocampus and temporal clustering in free recall.

This project:

* **Explores How Context Changes Affect Brain Activity:** Investigate how changing the background environment at different speeds influences activity in the hippocampus.

* **Explores How Context Changes Affect Memory Organization:** Investigate how changing the background environment at different rates while learning words influences how people remember the order of those words later.

* **Links Brain Activity to Memory Organization:** Examine whether changes in activity in the hippocampus during learning are correlated with how people group and recall memories based on the order they were learned.

I led the project in collaboration with [Dr. Brice Kuhl](https://kuhllab.com/), [Dr. Sarah DuBrow](https://www.dubrowlab.org/) (In Memorium), [Dr. Wanjia Guo](https://wanjiag.github.io/), and Dr. Zhifang Ye


<h2 style="font-size:24px;">Methods</h2>

Literature review, experiment and survey design, participant recruitment, neuroimaging (fMRI) data collection, verbal data trasnscription, data analysis (R, Excel, Python), scientific writing and communication 

<h2 style="font-size:24px;">Key Takeaways and Insights</h2>

While context switch rate had no effect on the total number of words recalled, it significantly influenced the degree of temporal clustering, or how likely individuals were to recall the words in temporal order. Specifically, a higher context switch rate was associated with less temporal clustering. Strikingly, this pattern of data was mirrored by activity in the hippocampus. Most importantly, hippocampal activity during learning was positively correlated with temporal clustering during free recall. **Collectively, these findings establish a critical link between context representations in the hippocampus and temporal clustering in free recall.**
