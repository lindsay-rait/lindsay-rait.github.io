<h1 style="font-size:24px;">RAPID CONTEXT CHANGES AT ENCODING DISRUPT HIPPOCAMPAL AUTOCORRELATION AND REDUCE TEMPORAL CLUSTERING OF FREE RECALL</h1>


<h2 style="font-size:24px;">Background</h2>

The hippocampus is a region in the brain that is critical for forming long term memories. Specifically, the hippocampus is essential for linking memories of past experiences to rich contextual details—memory for ‘where’ or ‘when’ an event took place. Prior research has shown that context powerfully shapes the order in which items are remembered- or how memories are organized. This has been demonstrated in previous research, where participants tend to recall items in the order they were learned. This phenomenon is known as **temporal clustering**, where individuals group their memories based on the order in which they experienced them. At present, however, there is limited evidence linking context representations in the hippocampus and temporal clustering in free recall.


<h2 style="font-size:24px;">Project Goals</h2>

**Explore How Context Changes Affect Memory Organization:** Investigate how changing the background environment at different rates while learning words influences how people remember the order of those words later.

**Explore How Context Changes Affect Brain Activity:** Investigate how changing the background environment at different speeds influences activity in the hippocampus.

**Link Brain Activity to Memory Organization:** Examine whether changes in activity in the hippocampus during learning are correlated with how people group and recall memories based on the order they were learned.

We conducted an fMRI experiment with 38 participants. Participants viewed alternating presentations of scenes and words. Participants had to indicate whether you _could_ find the item represented by the word in the previous scene (yes/no). Participants studied 24 words per round. After each round, participants verbally recalled as many words as possible (a). The scene context changed at four rates (within-subjects): high (every 2 words), medium (every 6 words), low (every 12 words), and no switch (same scene throughout; b). We tested whether manipulating the rate of context change during learning influenced the stability of hippocampal representations (measured by autocorrelation) as well as the degree of temporal clustering during subsequent recall.
