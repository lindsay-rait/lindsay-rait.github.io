#short_description: The hippocampus plays a critical role in processing contextual information. Additionally, context powerfully shapes how our memories are organized. In this study, we establish a link between context representations in the hippocampus and memory organization.

Led a brain imaging study to explore whether changes in the environment at different speeds cause similar effects in both brain activity and the way we remember things

<strong>Role</strong>: Lead Researcher | In collaboration with [Dr. Brice Kuhl](https://kuhllab.com/), [Dr. Sarah DuBrow](https://www.dubrowlab.org/) (In Memorium), [Dr. Wanjia Guo](https://wanjiag.github.io/), and Dr. Zhifang Ye

How does the speed at which the environment changes influence brain activity and the order in which we remember information?

This project investigated the link between changes in our environment and memory organization, with a focus on the hippocampus‚Äîthe brain region essential for memory. Specifically, it explored:

* **How environment changes affect brain activity:** Investigated how changing the background environment at different speeds influenced activity in the hippocampus.

* **How environment changes affect memory organization:** Investigated how changing the background environment at different speeds while learning words influenced how people remember the order of those words later.

* **How brain activity relates to memory organization:** Examined whether changes in activity in the hippocampus during learning are correlated with how people group and recall memories based on the order they were learned.

I designed and led this project from start to finish, including:

- Conducted literature reviews and developed experiment hypotheses
- Recruited participants through emails and phone calls
- Collected neuroimaging (fMRI) data (38 total participants)
- Trained junior researchers to transcribe data 
- Analyzed behavioral and fMRI data using R, Excel, and Python
- Created data visualizations in R and Adobe Illustrator 
- Wrote and communicated research findings for both academic and applied audiences

<h2 style="font-size:24px;">üß† Key Insights </h2> 

While context switch rate had no effect on the total number of words recalled, it significantly influenced the degree of temporal clustering, or how likely individuals were to recall the words in temporal order. Specifically, a higher context switch rate was associated with less temporal clustering. Strikingly, this pattern of data was mirrored by activity in the hippocampus. Most importantly, hippocampal activity during learning was positively correlated with temporal clustering during free recall. **Collectively, these findings establish a critical link between context representations in the hippocampus and temporal clustering in free recall.**
