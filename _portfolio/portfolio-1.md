_Full publication can be found here_

**Project Goals:**

**Understand How Context Changes Affect Memory:** Explore how switching between different environments or situations influences how people remember and organize information.

 **Test the Impact of Familiar vs. New Environments on Memory:** Investigate whether people remember things better when they switch between familiar environments compared to when they switch to new, unfamiliar ones.

**Explore How Fast Context Changes Affect Memory Organization:** Analyze whether the speed at which people switch environments changes the way they group and recall information, especially focusing on the role of time in organizing memories
