<h1 style="font-size:32px;">CONTEXTUAL FAMILIARITY RESCUES THE COST OF SWITCHING</h1>

<h2 style="font-size:24px;">Background</h2>

Our environment is constantly changing, filled with switches in context (where/when something occurs) varying in how often switches occur as well as prior exposure to the contexts (i.e., relative novelty).  These types of changes profoundly infuence how much we remember. For instance, imagine a typical Sunday afternoon. You could spend the day watching a movie in the living room while preparing lunch in the kitchen. If asked to recall what happened in the movie, your later memory of a specifc scene may become linked with memories of preparing lunch, helping you remember both events. Instead, you could run errands in a new shopping mall. You may have difficulty recalling all the items purchased since you were rapidly switching between each new store. While previous research has shown that context affects memory performance, it is still unclear how different aspects of context —such how familiar they are or as how quickly they change—affect how we organize and structure our memories.

<h2 style="font-size:24px;">Project Goals</h2>

* **Understand How Context Change Affects Memory:** Explore how switching between different environments (contexts) influences how people remember and organize information.

* **Explore How Fast Context Changes Influence Memory:** Analyze whether the rate of context change influences how much information people can remember as well as the order in which they remember it. 

* **Investigate the Influence of Familiar vs. Novel Contexts on Memory:** Investigate whether people remember things better when they switch between familiar environments compared to when they switch to novel ones.




<h2 style="font-size:24px;">Approach</h2>

_Experiment 1 (84 participants):_

* Participants viewed alternating presentations of scenes and words. Participants studied 24 words per round. After each round, participants verbally recalled as many words as possible (a). The scene context changed at three rates (within-subjects): high (every 2 words), low (every 4 words), and no switch (same scene throughout; b). Additionally, participants (between-subjects) experienced either repeated contexts (switching between the same two scenes) or novel contexts (each switch introduced a new scene; c).

_Experiment 2 (167 participants):_

* This experiment followed largely the same procedure with a few exceptions:
   * Participants studied 16 words per round.
   * A minimum recall time was added to encourage more thorough memory search.


<h2 style="font-size:24px;">Results</h2>

In two experiments, we found and replicated that memory was only worse when switching quickly between novel contexts, not when switching between familiar (repeated) contexts. In fact, when the context was familiar (repeated) memory was just as good during when the context was changing rapidly as when it was not changing at all. This suggests that when the context is changing quickly, familiarity with the context can help reduce the negative effects of fast switching. This suggests that the rate of context change matters more when the context is unfamiliar.

We found that the number of words that participants remembered was only worse when the context changed at the high rate. To undersand why this happened, we looked at the order in which participants recalled the words. Specifically, we asked, when a participant recalled a word, what word do they recall next, and what scene was it associated with? We observed that the way participants organized their memories differed when the context switched rapidly. 


<h2 style="font-size:24px;">Key Takeaway: Familiarity with a context can rescue the costs to memory that are associated with rapidly switching to new tasks environments</h2>
