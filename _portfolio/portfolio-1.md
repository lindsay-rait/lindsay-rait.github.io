#short_description: Changes in context influence the way we form and structure memories. Yet, little is known about how qualitatively different types of context switches shape memory organization. These studies demonstrate that how often the context changes and the level of familiarity with the context influences the structure and organization of memory.

Our environment is constantly changing, filled with switches in context (where/when something occurs) varying in how often switches occur as well as prior exposure to the contexts (i.e., relative novelty).  These types of changes profoundly infuence how much we remember. For instance, imagine a typical Sunday afternoon. You could spend the day watching a movie in the living room while preparing lunch in the kitchen. 
If asked to recall what happened in the movie, your later memory of a specifc scene may become linked with memories of preparing lunch, helping you remember both events. Instead, you could run errands in a new shopping mall. You may have difficulty recalling all the items purchased since you were rapidly switching between each new store. 
While previous research has shown that context affects memory performance, **it is still unclear how different aspects of context —such how familiar they are or as how quickly they change—affect how we organize and structure our memories.**

This project explores: 

* **How Context Change Affects Memory:** Explore how switching between different environments (contexts) influences how people remember and organize information.

* **How the Rate of Context Change Influences Memory:** Analyze whether rapid vs. slower context changes influence how much information people can remember as well as the order in which they remember it. 

* **The Influence of Familiar vs. Novel Contexts on Memory:** Investigate whether people remember things better when they switch between familiar environments compared to when they switch to novel ones.

<h2 style="font-size:24px;">My Role</h2>

I led the project in collaboration with [Dr. Vishnu Murty](https://www.adaptivememorylab.com/) and [Dr. Sarah DuBrow](https://www.dubrowlab.org/) (In Memorium) 


<h2 style="font-size:24px;">Methods</h2>

Literature review, experiment and survey design, A/B testing, remote data collection (Prolific), verbal data trasnscription, data analysis (R, Excel), scientific writing and communication 

<h2 style="font-size:24px;">Key Takeaways and Insights</h2>

We found and replicated that memory was only worse when switching quickly between novel contexts, not when switching between familiar contexts. In fact, when the context was familiar, memory was just as good when the context was changing rapidly vs. it was not changing at all. We also observed that the order in which participants recalled the items differed when the context switched rapidly. **Taken together, this suggests that both the rate of context change and level of familiarity with the contexts are important for memory. Being familiar with a context can rescue the costs to memory that are associated with rapidly switching to new tasks and environments.**

Task Switching is unavoidable. Thus, an understanding of how to limit detriments to memory because of switching between tasks may have several broad implications. In particular, this research will help to understand the increasingly common case of media multitasking, the concurrent use of two streams of media or the use of media while engaging in a non-media activity. Media multitasking is especially prevalent in education, where students often send text messages while studying or use their laptop during a lecture. Implementing more effective task-switching strategies in the classroom can promote better learning and memory of the material.
