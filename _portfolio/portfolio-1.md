#short_description: Changes in context influence the way we form and structure memories. Yet, little is known about how qualitatively different types of context switches shape memory organization. These studies demonstrate that how often the context changes and the level of familiarity with the context influences the structure and organization of memory.

### üîç Project Goal  
How does our ability to remember information change when we switch between different environments?

This project investigated how two factors influence memory:  
- **How rapidly the environment changes** (rapid vs. slow switching)  
- **How familiar the environments are** (familiar vs. novel environments)

---

### üß™ My Role & Methods  
I designed and led this project from start to finish, including:

- Conducted literature reviews and developed experiment hypotheses
- Designed a novel experimental paradigm and iterated over different experimental designs (A/B testing)
- Collected data for two online experiments (251 total participants)
- Trained junior researchers to transcribe data 
- Analyzed behavioral data using R and Excel
- Created data visualizations in R and Adobe Illustrator 
- Wrote and communicated research findings for both academic and applied audiences

### üß† Key Insights  
- **Memory is worse when environments change quickly‚Äîbut only when the new environments are unfamiliar.**  
- **When the same environments repeat (i.e., are familiar), rapid switching no longer hurts memory.**  
- **Rapid environment changes lead to differences in the order in which items are remembered**

‚û°Ô∏è This suggests that **familiarity with an environment can help protect memory from the negative effects of switching rapidly**

### üí° Why It Matters  
Task-switching is a common part of everyday life‚Äîfrom switching between browser tabs to managing work, communication, and personal tasks. Our findings have important implications for how we approach multitasking and memory.

This has potential applications in:
- **Education** (e.g., understanding how distractions affect learning and retention)
- **Workplace productivity** (e.g., improving focus and memory during task-switching)
- **Media multitasking habits** (e.g., managing how people engage with multiple sources of information)
