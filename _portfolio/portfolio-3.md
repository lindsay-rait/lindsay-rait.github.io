My previous research examined how changes in external context—such as the environment or surroundings—affect how people organize their memories during recall. However, less is known about how shifts in internal context—such as a person’s thoughts or goals—shape memory organization.
Research shows that individuals tend to prioritize goal-relevant information in memory. In fact, one study found that people tend to organize their memories based on the monetary reward value of the item, remembering items with similar rewards together.
However, it is less clear how agency influences how memories are organized.

This project explores: 

* **How Agency in Decision-Making Shapes Memory Organization:** Investiagte how imbuing individuals with agency influences the order in which items are remembered.

* **Is Memory Organized More by Time or Choices:** Examine whether whether people remember items more based on what choices they made or the order in which they originally learned them.

I led the project in collaboration with Dr. Elizabeth Horwath, [Dr. Vishnu Murty](https://www.adaptivememorylab.com/) and [Dr. Sarah DuBrow](https://www.dubrowlab.org/) (In Memorium) 


<h2 style="font-size:24px;">Methods</h2>

Literature review, experiment and survey design, remote data collection (Prolific), verbal data trasnscription, data analysis (R, Excel), scientific writing and communication 

<h2 style="font-size:24px;">Key Takeaways and Insights</h2>

The present study shows the structure of memory recall was shaped by how items were assigned at encoding. Participants who had no agency over their choices relied more on temporal information to organize recall, where they were more likely to retrieve items in the order they were studied. In contrast, those who actively made choices were less dependent on temporal structure and instead organized their recall around the character to whom they had assigned the items. This suggests that making choices during encoding creates a meaningful context that later guides memory organization.
