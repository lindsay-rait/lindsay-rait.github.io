My previous research examined how changes in external context—such as the environment or surroundings—affect how people organize their memories during recall. However, less is known about how shifts in internal context—such as a person’s thoughts or goals—shape memory organization.
Research shows that individuals tend to prioritize goal-relevant information in memory. In fact, one study found that people tend to organize their memories based on the monetary reward value of the item, remembering items with similar rewards together.
However, it is less clear how more more naturalistic, goal-relevant memories are organized.

This project explores: 

* **How Goal-Relevance Shapes Memory Organization:** Investiagte how having an active goal influences the order in which items are remembered.

* **Is Memory Organized More by Time or Goals:** Examine whether whether people remember items more based on their internal goals or the order in which they originally learned them.
