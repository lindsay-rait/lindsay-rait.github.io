Designed and led an online experiment to explore how having agency over decision-making influences the order in which people recall information from memory

<strong>Role</strong>: Lead Researcher | In collaboration with [Dr. Vishnu Murty](https://www.adaptivememorylab.com/), [Dr. Sarah DuBrow](https://www.dubrowlab.org/) (In Memorium), and Dr. Elizabeth Horwath

How does agency influence how memories are organized?

Specifically, this project explores: 
* **How Agency during decision-making shapes memory organization:** Investiagted how imbuing individuals with agency influences the order in which items are remembered

* **Whether memory is organized more by time or choices:** Examined whether whether people remember items more based on what choices they made or the order in which they originally learned them

<h2 style="font-size:24px;">üß™ My Role & Methods </h2> 
I designed and led this project from start to finish, including:

- Conducted literature reviews and developed experiment hypotheses
- Designed a novel experimental paradigm
- Collected data for one online experiment (132 total participants)
- Trained junior researchers to transcribe data 
- Analyzed behavioral data using R and Excel
- Created data visualizations in R and Adobe Illustrator 
- Wrote and communicated research findings for both academic and applied audiences

<h2 style="font-size:24px;">üß† Key Insights </h2> 

- **When people had no control over their choices**, they tended to remember items in the order they were learned, relying more on the sequence of events
- **When people had control over their choices**, they organized their memories based on the choices they made, showing less reliance on temporal order and more on the meaningful associations they created during learning

‚û°Ô∏è This suggests having **agency during decision-making provides a meaningful framework** that influences how memories are organized and recalled
