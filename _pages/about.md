I am a cognitive scientist with 8+ years of experience designing and leading experimental research to better understand human behavior. I specialize in designing novel experiments, analyzing complex data, and communicating scientific insights in ways that both researchers and the general public can understand. I am passionate about using these skills to tackle real-world challenges, particularly in healthcare, and I am excited to bring this experience into research roles that require both critical thinking and creativity.

During my Ph.D. in Psychology at the University of Oregon, I used behavioral experiments, neuroimaging (fMRI), and computational methods to explore how our environment shapes what we learn and remember. I am especially interested in applying insights from this work in new contexts where understanding human behavior can drive meaningful change.
