I am a PhD candidate in Cognitive Neuroscience at the Universtiy of Oregon. My expertise is in using human behavior, neuroimaging, and computational methods to understand how people learn and remember. My research is driven by an inherent curiosity about how context—such as where and when an experience takes place— shapes human behavior.

With over 8 years of experience in designing and conducting experimental psychology and neuroimaging studies, I have honed my skills in analyzing complex, mixed-method datasets and effectively communicating scientific findings. I am passionate about applying my expertise to solve data-driven problems that have real-world impact and am eager to take on new challenges that require critical and creative thinking.
