I am a PhD candidate in Cognitive Neuroscience at the Universtiy of Oregon. My expertise is in using human behavior, neuroimaging, and computational modeling to understand how people learn and remember. I am inherently curious about the role of context (where/when an event occurs) in shaping human behavior. I have 8+ years of experience in designing experimental psychology and neuroimaging experiments, analyzing multi-method datasets, and interpreting and communicating scientific results. I am eager to take on new challenges that allow me to think critically and creatively about data-driven problems with real-world impact.
