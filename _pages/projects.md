* **Contextual familiarity rescues the cost of switching**  
For this project, I tested how two qualitative features of context change (frequency and relative novelty) influenced the probability of remembering individual words and the order in which the words were remembered (i.e., recall organization). 

* **Investigating the effects of goal-relevance on free recall organization**  
While my previous project explored the influence of changes in external context on recall organization, the influence of changes in internal context on memory organization has received less attention in prior literature. This project explores whether internal goals can function as a context that organizes memories. The main questions are (1) whether internal goals active during memory encoding influence recall organization, and (2) more specifically, whether memory recall is more strongly organized according to internal goals (goal-based clustering) versus the temporal order in which items were studied. I found that when participants had an internal goal, they were more likely to organize their memories according to that goal. 

* **Rate of context change at encoding influences hippocampal autocorrelation and temporal clustering of free recall**  
I conducted an fMRI study to investigate (1) whether I can manipulate the rate of hippocampal drift during encoding and (2) whether manipulating the rate of hippocampal drift during encoding then influences temporal clustering during verbal free recall.

* **Content-based dissociation of hippocampal involvement in prediction**

* **Functional communication between the ventral hippocampus and anterior olfactory nucleus supports context-based odor memory in rats**
